     <p>In his debut film Ninnu Kori, director Shiva Nirvana explored the dynamic between a married woman and her ex-lover. In Majili, he told the tale of a heartbroken man whoâ€™s so stuck in the past, he cannot see the happiness that lies in front of him. And Kushi explores the tale of a couple who get what they want, only to realise, they might not be equipped for it.
